AR models work on the AutoCorrelation property of timeseries. Beauty of R, is that R can fit a given Timeseries into a best fit AR model ( yes, the AIC,BIC criteria are built in ) and then predicts the series for a few candles ahead.Not a great addition to Prediction value as i found with simple AR,but yes a very good starting point :)
